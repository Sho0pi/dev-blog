[{"categories":["Android Root"],"content":"How to Safely Update a Rooted Google Pixel Updating a rooted Pixel device doesn’t have to be risky or complicated. This guide walks you through the process of updating your device while preserving root access and user data. Note ✅ Your data will NOT be wiped during this process. However, it’s recommended to back up important data just in case. Some rooted apps, Magisk modules, or LSPosed modules may not support the new Android version. Always verify compatibility before proceeding - downgrading is often not possible after an update. Step 1: Disable Magisk Modules Magisk modules can interfere with OTA or factory image updates. To prevent bootloops or failed installs: Open the Magisk app. Go to the Modules tab. Disable (untick) all installed modules. Reboot your phone. Step 2: Install the Firmware Visit the official Pixel factory images page. Locate the version you want (usually the latest one at the bottom). Click Link to download the .zip image package for your device (used for patching). Click Flash to launch Google’s official web flashing tool. When prompted, allow ADB access in your browser. Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your phone. If the device isn’t detected: Run adb kill-server and reconnect the phone. In the web UI: Select your device. Leave all advanced options unchecked (unless you’re experienced). Click Install Build and follow the on-screen instructions. ⚠️ Do not disconnect the device during installation. It may take several minutes depending on your internet speed. Once completed, your device will reboot into the new Android version. Step 3: Patch the init_boot.img with Magisk Extract the downloaded .zip firmware and locate init_boot.img inside a file like image-\u003cbuild\u003e.zip. Push it to your phone: adb push init_boot.img /sdcard/ On your phone: Open the Magisk app. Tap Install Magisk on the home screen. Choose Select and patch a file. Select the init_boot.img file you just pushed. Tap LET’S GO. The app will output the location of the patched file, e.g., /sdcard/Download/magisk_patched.img. Pull the patched image back to your computer: adb pull /sdcard/Download/magisk_patched.img . Step 4: Flash the Patched Image Power off your phone and boot into Fastboot mode: Info Typically, press and hold Power + Volume Up simultaneously. Verify connection: fastboot devices Flash the patched image: fastboot flash init_boot magisk_patched.img Reboot your phone. You should now have root access restored. Final Step: Re-enable Modules Open Magisk again. Re-enable your desired Magisk and LSPosed modules. Restart your phone once more. ✅ Done! You now have an updated Pixel device with full root access restored.
